Senators serve six-year terms, and elections are staggered so each state's two senators are not up for re-election at the same time. The 2022 California Senatorial Election you'll be voting in will determine one of these two seats.\n\nThe primary role of a U.S. Senator is to represent the people of their state in the federal government. They have the power to draft and vote on federal laws, approve or reject treaties and diplomatic appointments, and serve as part of the jury in impeachment trials. \n\nSenators also share with the House of Representatives the power to propose changes to the U.S. Constitution, which then need to be approved by three-quarters of the states. One of the explicit limits on a senator's power is that they can't introduce legislation that appropriates money; such bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn terms of what makes a senator successful, they must be skilled at negotiation and persuasion, as they often have to work with colleagues across party lines to achieve their goals. They should also be good communicators, able to explain complex issues to their constituents and to persuade them of their viewpoints.\n\nA successful senator also needs to be a good listener, as they must understand the concerns and needs of a wide range of constituents. They should be able to balance the sometimes conflicting needs of their state's constituents with the broader national interest.\n\nFinally, they should have a solid understanding of the law and the Constitution, as they will be making decisions that impact these areas. They should also have a strong work ethic and the resilience to navigate the often challenging political terrain of the Senate.\n\nWhen voting, you might want to consider their voting record (if they have one), their stance on key issues that matter to you, their reputation for integrity and ethical behavior, and their ability to work with others to get things done. You might also want to look at their experience: have they held political office before? Do they have experience in areas that are relevant to the work of a senator, like law, public policy, or business? \n\nRemember, a senator isn't just representing you, they're representing your entire state on the national stage. It's important to choose someone who you believe will do that job well."}
